As our encoder hidden states are a sequence of $T$ tensors, and our previous decoder hidden state is a single tensor, the first thing we do is `repeat` the previous decoder hidden state $T$ times. We then calculate the energy, $E_t$, between them by concatenating them together and passing them through a linear layer (`attn`) and a $\\tanh$ activation function. \n",
